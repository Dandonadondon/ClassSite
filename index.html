                <h3>Adele and John's Wedding</h3>

                <p> <img src="assets/images/ArrowPhotograhyPortfolio1.jpg" alt="Wedding photography" /> </p>

                <p> &ldquo;Adele and John&rdquo; wanted some wedding photos of just
                    themselves around Sydney Harbour with the <em>Sydney Opera House, Botanical
                    Gardens</em> and <em>Sydney Harbour Bridge</em> as the backdrop. We met up with them
                    one sunny afternoon on the Sydney Opera House steps and spent some time
                    capturing some greats shots of them both in these awe-inspiring locations.
                    After shooting in front of the <em>Opera House and Bridge</em>, we walked into
                    <em>Sydney's Botanical Gardens</em> with the city behind them and captured some
                    great natural moments between the two of them. After a glass or two of
                    Champagne, we wandered through the gardens to <em>Mrs Macquaries Point</em> and
                    photographed the bride and groom with the iconic <em>Opera House</em> and <em>Harbour
                    Bridge</em> behind them. </p>

                <h3>Jane and Richard's Wedding</h3>

                <p> <img src="assets/images/ArrowPhotograhyPortfolio2.jpg" alt="Wedding photography" /> </p>
                <p> &quot;Jane and Richard's wedding&quot; was at St. Wilfrid's
                    Church, Calverley and the wedding reception took place at the <em>Mercure Parkway
                    Hotel, Leeds</em>. All the groomsmen were in kilts as the groom is Scottish and there
                    was definitely a Scottish theme to the day. After the ceremony we were lucky enough
                    for some sunshine to come out just at the right moment so the bride and groom
                    could have the <strong>roof down</strong> on the wedding car. We worked quickly in the short
                    time we had sun to capture some great photos of the bride and groom through
                    the trees with the sunshine behind outside the <em>Mercure Parkway Hotel</em>. The
                    wedding speeches had everyone in stitches as the best man had prepared a
                    slide-show of photos from the stag do! </p>
